## 📘 Chapter 77 – *“The Distance Between Us”*

This chapter opens with a mood of **emotional hesitation**. After the intense events of the previous arc, Iseop is seen pulling away emotionally — not because he wants to, but because he’s scared of how deeply he’s beginning to care.

### 🧠 Key Highlights:

* **Iseop** is shown reflecting alone, reading old notes from Yujin and recalling the times he hurt her unintentionally.
* Meanwhile, **Yujin** confesses to a friend that she’s tired of guessing whether Iseop’s heart is truly in this — or if she’s just a placeholder for something he lost long ago.
* The mood is melancholic but beautifully written, with visuals showing **physical closeness but emotional distance**.

📝 *“We’re always close enough to touch, but never close enough to hold,”* Yujin whispers at one point — a line that really summarizes their complicated dynamic.

## 💗 Chapter 78 – *“A Step Closer”*

After the tension in Chapter 77, Chapter 78 offers a **soft breakthrough** — but not the kind fans might expect.

### 💬 Key Developments:

* Iseop visits a place from his childhood that reminds him of who he used to be before the emotional walls were built.
* He begins to write a letter to Yujin — but doesn’t send it. Instead, he chooses to **speak to her in person**.
* When they finally meet, there’s silence… then honesty. He admits he’s scared of being loved “the right way” because he doesn’t feel he deserves it.
* The chapter ends not with a kiss or dramatic scene — but with **Yujin reaching out and holding his hand**, saying: *“Then let me show you how love is supposed to feel.”*

🎨 The art is stunning in this chapter, using soft pastels and close-ups to show how even a small gesture — like a touch — can carry powerful emotion.
